### Reason for climate change:
The main mechanism behind anthropological climate change is the emission and effect of greenhouse gasses in the earths athmosphere. 

As the sun has a surface temperature of around 5.500C, it emits most of its energy as shortwave radiation in near-infraread and visable wavelengths as sunlight.
In contrast, earths surface has a much lower temperature, emitting longwave radiation at mid- and far-infraread wavelengths. So if a sunray hits the earths body, the earth absorbs the radiation, and mostly emits the infrared radiation back, with some of it being reflected (the blacker, the more absorbed) and then partially re-emitted as infrared radiation. 
Greenhouse gasses are gasses that particularly absorb infrared radiation, making it unable to pass through.

Example for these greenhouse gasses include CO2, methane, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and even water vapor in the form of clouds.

https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector:
![[Pasted image 20240601151228.png]]
One can find out that carbon emissions are mainly concentrated in four major areas, successively decreasing in size:
- Energy use in Industrial plants (24%) + Releases in industry (+5.2%, mainly cement)
- Energy use in buildings, both commercial and residential (17.5%)
- Road transport (11.9%)
- The raising of lifestock (5.8%)

Methane:
- Almost half of pollution produced by methane

### Big data collection:
Actually, I have some experience with this, however from the opposite perspective:
Because for some time now I have been very interested in machine learning and data science,
and data collected through online services is often very comfortable to work with:
You could have a very small website with what only appears to be a handful of customers, and they will have a dataset with like 30.000 rows of user data, and you'd look at that and shed some tears of joy.

And thats because many datasets collected in the real world usually involve a lot of missing entries, very unlikely outliers and other issues that require preprocessing of the data,
just due to the fact that people lie about their data, dont answer certain questions etc.
But with datasets collected online, you aren't even asked questions: you click through some dialog to allow the collection of cookies, agree to terms of services that know one besides the laywers writing them will ever read and, without any further action by yourself, you will end up in some column.

And this really is where the issue lies: you become part of a statistic you never conciously agreed to. Data is collected about you without you having a say.

Also, this data is then used to "enhance the user experience" which, realistically, translates to enhanced algorithms designed to make you spend as much time as possible on their websites, with the end goal of you spending more money on products that ads recommend to you

And the only real advantage for you as a user is that you get free content, because the companies can make profit off of you in such an efficient way as to render direct payments unnessisary.
### Edward Snowden:
Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, gained international attention in 2013 when he leaked classified information detailing extensive global surveillance programs conducted by the NSA and other intelligence agencies. Snowden's revelations exposed the depth and breadth of government surveillance, including the monitoring of phone calls, internet activity, and various forms of electronic communication of both American citizens and foreign nationals.

**Key Points about the Situation:**
1. **The Leaks**:
    
    - Snowden disclosed documents that revealed the NSA's PRISM program, which allowed direct access to data from major tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple.
    - He also exposed the bulk collection of telephone metadata under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act.
2. **Government Response**:
    
    - The U.S. government charged Snowden with theft of government property and violations of the Espionage Act.
    - Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia, where he was granted asylum. As of 2023, he remains in Russia.
3. **Impact on Privacy and Surveillance Laws**:
    
    - Snowden's disclosures sparked a global debate about privacy, surveillance, and government overreach.
    - The revelations led to significant legal and policy changes, including the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015, which ended the bulk collection of phone metadata by the NSA and introduced new transparency measures.
4. **Public and Industry Reaction**:
    
    - The leaks prompted widespread public outrage and increased awareness about digital privacy and government surveillance.
    - Tech companies and privacy advocates have since pushed for stronger encryption and more robust data protection measures.
5. **Ongoing Concerns**:
    
    - Despite reforms, concerns about mass surveillance persist, particularly with advancements in technology such as artificial intelligence and biometric monitoring.
    - Privacy advocates continue to push for more stringent controls and oversight on government surveillance activities.

Edward Snowden's actions have had a lasting impact on the discourse surrounding privacy and surveillance, highlighting the need for a balance between national security and individual privacy rights. His situation remains a contentious and highly debated topic in discussions about civil liberties in the digital age.

### The green new deal:
The Green New Deal is an ambitious and comprehensive public policy framework designed to address the urgent issue of climate change while simultaneously achieving a range of complementary goals. These include creating jobs, stimulating economic growth, and reducing societal inequalities. At its core, the Green New Deal envisions a transformative shift towards a sustainable and equitable future.

In recent years, significant efforts have been made to translate this vision into actionable legislation in various countries, notably within the European Union and the United States. These legislative attempts aim to integrate the principles of the Green New Deal into national and regional policies, driving forward the necessary changes to combat climate change effectively.

The central focus of the Green New Deal is to promote environmental justice, particularly for communities disproportionately affected by climate change. These communities often bear the brunt of environmental degradation, pollution, and the adverse effects of a changing climate, despite contributing the least to the problem. By addressing these inequities, the Green New Deal seeks to ensure that the benefits of a green economy are shared widely and that vulnerable populations are protected and empowered.

In summary, the Green New Deal represents a holistic approach to tackling climate change, intertwining environmental sustainability with social and economic justice. It advocates for a paradigm shift in how we approach policy-making, prioritizing the health of the planet and the well-being of all its inhabitants.

1. **Historical Context:**
    
    - The term "Green New Deal" draws inspiration from the New Deal, a series of programs and reforms introduced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression. Similarly, the Green New Deal aims to address a profound crisis—climate change—through transformative economic and social reforms.
2. **Key Proposals:**
    
    - The Green New Deal encompasses a broad array of proposals, including:
        - Transitioning to 100% renewable energy sources by a specified date.

    - The Green New Deal emphasizes social justice, aiming to address the intersection of environmental issues and systemic inequalities. This includes ensuring fair wages, workers' rights, and support for communities historically marginalized and disproportionately impacted by environmental hazards.
5. **Challenges and Criticisms:**
    
    - Critics of the Green New Deal often point to the high costs and logistical challenges associated with its implementation. They argue that the ambitious goals may be economically disruptive and difficult to achieve within the proposed timelines. Others believe the plan lacks specific details on funding and execution.
6. **Global Perspective:**
    
    - While the Green New Deal is most prominently associated with the U.S. and the EU, similar initiatives are emerging worldwide. Countries like South Korea and Canada have introduced their own versions of green economic plans, tailored to their specific needs and circumstances.
7. **Political Landscape:**
    
    - The Green New Deal has sparked considerable political debate. In the U.S., it has garnered strong support from progressive politicians and environmental groups, while facing opposition from conservatives and industry stakeholders who favor more gradual approaches to climate action.
8. **Legislative Efforts:**
    
    - In the U.S., the Green New Deal was introduced as a non-binding resolution in Congress in 2019 by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey. Although it has not been passed into law, it has significantly influenced the national conversation on climate policy and inspired various legislative proposals at federal, state, and local levels.
9. **Public Opinion:**
    
    - Public support for the Green New Deal varies, with younger generations and climate activists generally more supportive, viewing it as essential for a sustainable future. Polls indicate growing awareness and concern about climate change, potentially increasing public backing for comprehensive climate policies.
10. **Future Outlook:**
    
    - The future of the Green New Deal depends on political will, public support, and the ability to build broad coalitions. As climate impacts become more severe, the pressure for bold action increases, potentially paving the way for policies inspired by the Green New Deal framework to gain traction and shape future climate action.
### Greenwashing
Lets begin with a definition: what is green washing?
Green washing refers to the act (of an individual or an organization) of making themselves appear more ecological on the surface than they actually are.
In class, we have identified some greenwashing techniques often observed in even the most ... such as shell: firstly, they often employ language that, while sounding like a promise of significan, isn"t defined in any way that would make claiming it a promise of any kind. Calling yourself "eco-friendly" for example seems like an arguable claim, that however lacks any formal definition to make it such. Additionaly, there is often an emphasis put on small details or products that, while technically being environmentally friendly, dont ecompass a large part of the actual operations of the company: for example, there is often a large emphasis on the footpring and recyclability of the packaging, even if the main product, e.g. a dishwasher, wasn"t produced ecologically at all.

### Problems with plastic:
**What He Learned About Plastic:** Andrew Forrest learned that plastic pollution is an escalating global crisis with dire consequences for marine life and ecosystems. He discovered that plastic waste is ubiquitous, breaking down into microplastics that permeate oceans, waterways, and eventually, the food chain. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation predicts that by 2025, the ocean could contain one ton of plastic for every three tons of fish, highlighting the urgent need for action.

**Why It Is So Worrisome:** The worrisome aspect of plastic pollution lies in its longevity and pervasive nature. Plastics do not biodegrade but rather break down into smaller pieces, which are ingested by marine organisms and enter the food web. This not only threatens marine biodiversity but also poses health risks to humans. Furthermore, the massive volume of plastic waste generated annually exacerbates environmental degradation and contributes to the loss of marine life.

**Why Nothing Is Done:** Forrest identifies several reasons for the lack of substantial action against plastic pollution:

- **Economic Interests:** The profitability of plastic production and petrochemical industries creates resistance to change.
- **Infrastructure Gaps:** Many countries lack the infrastructure for effective waste management and recycling.
- **Consumer Habits:** Widespread reliance on single-use plastics and insufficient consumer awareness hinder progress.
- **Policy and Regulation:** Inadequate regulations and enforcement mechanisms fail to hold producers accountable for plastic waste.

**What Should Be Done with the Resin:** Forrest proposes that plastic resin, the raw material for plastic production, should be transformed into a valuable commodity through recycling. By incentivizing the recycling of plastic resin, it can become a sustainable resource rather than waste. This involves:

- **Corporate Responsibility:** Encouraging large corporations to fund and drive recycling initiatives.
- **Technological Innovation:** Investing in advanced recycling technologies that can efficiently process plastic waste.
- **Support for Informal Recyclers:** Empowering informal waste collectors, or "ragpickers," by improving their working conditions and integrating them into formal recycling systems.

**How It May Benefit the Industry and Environment:**

- **Economic Opportunities:** Creating a circular economy around plastic can generate jobs and stimulate economic growth. Recycling industries can thrive, providing new business opportunities and reducing dependency on virgin plastic.
- **Environmental Benefits:** Reducing plastic waste through effective recycling lowers environmental pollution, protects marine life, and conserves natural resources. It also decreases the carbon footprint associated with plastic production.
- **Social Impact:** Supporting informal recyclers and integrating them into the formal economy improves their livelihoods and working conditions, contributing to social equity and economic inclusion.

By transforming the economic incentives around plastic and mobilizing corporate and technological resources, Forrest believes it is possible to mitigate the plastic crisis and create a sustainable future.

Outline the following text on: **The Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture and the Adaptive Responses Needed**

The impact of climate change on global agriculture is becoming increasingly evident. Rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events are **disrupting crop production worldwide**. In regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where agriculture is predominantly rain-fed, **changing weather patterns pose a significant threat to food security**. Farmers are facing **unpredictable growing seasons**, which can result in **poor yields** and **loss of income**. Moreover, **pests and diseases that thrive in warmer climates** are spreading to new areas, further jeopardizing crop health.

In response to these challenges, there is a growing interest in sustainable agricultural practices. Techniques such as crop diversification, agroforestry, and the use of drought-resistant crop varieties are being explored to enhance resilience. Governments and international organizations are also investing in agricultural research and development to find innovative solutions. For instance, the introduction of smart irrigation systems and precision farming technologies can help optimize water use and increase productivity.

However, adapting to climate change is not without its hurdles. Smallholder farmers often lack access to the necessary resources and knowledge to implement these practices. There is a need for increased support through education, financial assistance, and infrastructure development to ensure that all farmers can benefit from these advancements. By addressing these issues, we can work towards a more resilient and sustainable agricultural future.


Outline the following text on **The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health**, on the detrimental effects social media can have on ones mental health

In today's digital age, social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, influencing various aspects of our personal and social interactions. While these platforms offer numerous benefits, such as connectivity, information sharing, and community building, they also pose significant challenges to mental health.

One major concern is the **tendency for social media to foster unrealistic comparisons**. Users often present idealized versions of their lives, which can lead to feelings of **inadequacy and low self-esteem** among viewers. This phenomenon, known as "social comparison," can contribute to **anxiety and depression**, particularly in younger users who are still developing their self-identity.

Moreover, the **addictive nature of social media** **platforms** can **disrupt** **sleep patterns** and **reduce face-to-face interactions**, further exacerbating feelings of **loneliness and isolation**. The constant barrage of notifications and the pressure to stay constantly connected can lead to **stress and burnout**, affecting both mental and physical well-being.

**Cyberbullying** is another critical issue linked to social media usage. The anonymity and reach of these platforms can facilitate harassment and negative interactions, leading to emotional trauma and, in severe cases, suicidal thoughts.

Addressing the impact of social media on mental health requires a multifaceted approach, including promoting digital literacy, encouraging balanced usage, and fostering supportive online communities. By understanding and mitigating these risks, we can harness the positive aspects of social media while safeguarding our mental health.

Title: **Is Social Media Addictive? Here’s What the Science Says.** -> Feature
By Matt Richel, New York Times, Oct. 25, 2023 
Task: Read out the first two paragraphs. Outline the reasons why social media is addictive, especially for youngsters. Then discuss whether or not children should be given internet access from a young age on.

Experts who study internet use say that the magnetic allure of social media arises from the way the **content plays to our neurological impulses and wiring**, such that consumers find it hard to turn away from the incoming stream of information.
-> Content specifically made to please human brain

David Greenfield, a psychologist and founder of the Center for Internet and Technology Addiction in West Hartford, Conn., said the devices lure users with some powerful tactics. One is “**intermittent reinforcement**,” which creates the idea that a **user could get a reward** at any time. But when the reward comes is **unpredictable**. “Just like a slot machine,” he said. As with a slot machine, users are beckoned with lights and sounds but, **even more powerful, information and reward tailored** to a user’s interests and tastes.
-> Platforms uses sparse rewards in the form of especially tailored entertainment to through a process called intermittent reinforcement learning

Adults are susceptible, he noted, but young people are particularly at risk, because the brain regions that are **involved in resisting temptation and reward are not nearly as developed in children and teenagers as in adults**. “They’re all about impulse and not a lot about the control of that impulse,” Dr. Greenfield said of young consumers.
-> Lack of impulse control make them more susceptable

Moreover, he said, the adolescent brain is especially attuned to social connections, and “**social media is all a perfect opportunity to connect with other people**.”
-> Ability for broad social interactions more alluring

=> Ultimately all combining to make social media especially addicting to youngsters.

Meta responded to the lawsuit by saying that it had taken many steps to support families and teenagers. “We’re disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorneys general have chosen this path,” the company said in a statement.

- inspired bz
- Large, emotive debate in field of pedagogy and parenting
- two irreconcilably devided sides: no phones until early age, 
- deeply examine cons and pros related to the introduction and subsequently way them to reach nuanced conclusions

Cons:
- addiction -> myself, easy to fall into habits due to short term rewards
- poor social skills, overreliance -> friends that havent seen in like 8 months, not great

Pro:
- Ability to get advice on internet -> Never had problems, just google
- Ability to educate yourself -> Machine learning through online courses
-> All enhanced by being digital native w/ computer literacy

Conclusion: need to include the pros while mitigating negative effects -> controlled, supervised w/ relaxation according to age from early age on


1. Outline: How does social Media effects the mental health of the youth? Title: Everyone Says Social Media Is Bad for Teens. Proving It Is Another Thing. Author: Claire Cain Miller (New York Times)

    Reviews of the existing studies on social media use and adolescents’ mental health have found the bulk of them to be “weak,” “inconsistent,” “inconclusive,” “a bag of mixed findings” and “weighed down by a lack of quality” and “conflicting evidence.” 
    
    Research has not yet shown which sites, apps or features of social media have which effects on mental health. “We don’t have enough evidence to tell parents to get rid of a particular app, or cut it off after a particular number of hours,” said Sophia Choukas-Bradley, a psychologist and director of the Teen and Young Adult Lab at the University of Pittsburgh.
    
	 It’s also hard to prove that social media causes poor mental health, versus being correlated with it. Most studies measure time spent on social media and mental health symptoms, and many, though not all, have found a correlation. But other researchers say measuring time spent isn’t enough: In these studies, it’s unclear if time on social media is the problem, or if it’s time away from other things like exercising or sleeping. And the studies obscure, for instance, if someone is spending hours on screens to escape mental duress or to seek support from friends. A few studies have tried novel approaches around these problems. One, early in Facebook’s rollout in the mid-2000s, compared college campuses that had received access to it with those that hadn’t, and found that its arrival had a negative effect on students’ mental health. A carefully designed study, Project Awesome at the University of Amsterdam and Erasmus University in Rotterdam, looks at both the average effects of social media on 1,000 teenagers it surveys and how they differ by individual, and follows adolescents over time. It has found that time spent on social media is less of a factor than teenagers’ moods while using it.
