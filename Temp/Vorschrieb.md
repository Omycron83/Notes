- Climate change will have such a detrimental effect on the environment and, subsequently, our day-to-day-lifes, that it warrants immediate, sweeping reforms to our societal and economocial structures.
- Climate change, or at least anthropological climate change either doesnt exist or atleast wont have such large of an impact as to require actions that will irrevocably decrease the standard of living across the board.

Its important to first shed some light on the background to answer this question comprehensively: ...


### Reason for climate change:
The main mechanism behind anthropological climate change is the emission and effect of greenhouse gasses in the earths athmosphere. 
The main reason for this ... is the way thermal radiation is emitted and reflected by all bodies, in particular the plantes in our solar system.
Thhe general mechanism behind 

As the sun has a surface temperature of around 5.500C, it emits most of its energy as shortwave radiation in near-infraread and visable wavelengths as sunlight.
In contrast, earths surface has a much lower temperature, emitting longwave radiation at mid- and far-infraread wavelengths.
Greenhouse gasses are gasses that particularly absorb 

Example for these greenhouse gasses include CO2, methane, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and even water vapor in the form of clouds.


### Severn Suzuki Climate Change:
Back then, environmental activism was a very different thing than it is today: not only was the topic orders of magnitude less popular, but the talking points where different as well.


### Big data collection:
Actually, I have some experience with this, however from the opposite perspective:
Because for some time now I have been very interested in machine learning and data science,
and data collected through online services is often very comfortable to work with:
You could have a very small website with what only appears to be a handful of customers, and they will have a dataset with like 30.000 rows of user data, and you'd look at that and shed some tears of joy.

And thats because many datasets collected in the real world usually involve a lot of missing entries, very unlikely outliers and other issues that require preprocessing of the data,
just due to the fact that people lie about their data, dont answer certain questions etc.
But with datasets collected online, you aren't even asked questions: you click through some dialog to allow the collection of cookies, agree to terms of services that know one besides the laywers writing them will ever read and, without any further action by yourself, you will end up in some column.

And this really is where the issue lies: you become part of a statistic you never conciously agreed to. Data is collected about you without you having a say.

Also, this data is then used to "enhance the user experience" which, realistically, translates to enhanced algorithms designed to make you spend as much time as possible on their websites, with the end goal of you spending more money on products that ads recommend to you

And the only real advantage for you as a user is that you get free content, because the companies can make profit off of you in such an efficient way as to render direct payments unnessisary.
