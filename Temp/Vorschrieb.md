### Discussion 1
As I've already alluded to, there exists a large public debate / a substantial and fervent discourse in the field of pedagogy around..

And it is my impression that public opinion on the matter is somewhat irreconcilably divided: on one end of the spectrum, we have people claiming that ..., but on the other side, some argue that ... . 
This is because the topic is not only very complex with a lot of distinct talking points and ideas, but also highly emotive, largely due to ... .
So, in order to reach an appropriate, nuanced conclusion, one must both deeply examine and subsequently weigh the pros and cons associated with ...

- Climate change will have such a detrimental effect on the environment and, subsequently, our day-to-day-lifes, that it warrants immediate, sweeping reforms to our societal and economocial structures.
- Climate change, or at least anthropological climate change either doesnt exist or atleast wont have such large of an impact as to require actions that will irrevocably decrease the standard of living across the board. 

Lets start with the arguments in favor of ...

This actually brings us to arguments against ...

### Results of climate change:

#### Environmental Impacts:

1. **Rising Sea Levels**:
		Due to the increase in average temperatures, the previous balance between water and ice at the poles has been disturbed, leading to the ice at our poles and glacier melting by about 350 billion tons a year. Because the density of ice is smaller than that of water, this leads to an increase of average sea levels.
	
    - **Effects on Humans**: Increased flooding can displace communities, especially in low-lying coastal areas. Loss of land can lead to conflicts over resources and contribute to the displacement of millions of people, creating climate refugees.
2. **Extreme Weather Events**:
		This, together with changes in both global aerial and water circulation due to the changes in temperatures leads to an increase of the frequency of extreme weather events, such as 
		
    - **Effects on Humans**: More frequent and severe hurricanes, tornadoes, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall events can lead to loss of life, injury, and damage to property and infrastructure. The economic costs of recovery and rebuilding are substantial.
3. **Ocean Acidification**:
	    The worlds 
	    
    - **Effects on Humans**: Disruption of marine food chains can affect fisheries, which are a vital source of food and livelihood for millions of people worldwide.
4. **Glacial Retreat and Ice Melt**:
	    See above
	    
    - **Effects on Humans**: Loss of glaciers and ice sheets reduces freshwater availability for drinking, agriculture, and hydropower, especially for communities that rely on glacial meltwater.
5. **Desertification**:
	    Changes in 
	    
    - **Effects on Humans**: Expansion of deserts leads to the loss of arable land, impacting food production and leading to increased competition for resources, potentially causing conflicts and migration.

#### Biological Impacts:

1. **Loss of Biodiversity**:
    
    - **Effects on Humans**: Ecosystem services that humans depend on, such as pollination of crops, natural pest control, and medicinal resources, are disrupted, affecting food security and health.
2. **Shifts in Species Distribution**:
    
    - **Effects on Humans**: Changes in the distribution of species, including pests and disease vectors, can introduce new health risks and affect agriculture and fisheries.
3. **Coral Bleaching**:
    
    - **Effects on Humans**: The loss of coral reefs affects tourism and fisheries, which are crucial for the economies of many coastal communities.
4. **Forest Dieback**:
    
    - **Effects on Humans**: Forests provide resources such as timber, fuel, and non-timber forest products. Their loss can affect local economies and livelihoods, as well as reduce carbon sequestration, exacerbating climate change.

#### Societal Impacts:

1. **Food Security**:
    
    - **Effects on Humans**: Reduced agricultural productivity can lead to food shortages, higher prices, and increased malnutrition, particularly affecting vulnerable populations.
2. **Water Scarcity**:
    
    - **Effects on Humans**: Reduced access to clean water for drinking, agriculture, and sanitation can lead to health issues, increased competition for water resources, and potential conflicts.
3. **Health Risks**:
    
    - **Effects on Humans**: Increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns can exacerbate health issues through heat stress, spread of infectious diseases, poor air quality, and malnutrition. Vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and children, are at higher risk.
4. **Economic Impact**:
    
    - **Effects on Humans**: Damage to infrastructure, reduced agricultural output, and increased healthcare costs strain economies. Poor communities are disproportionately affected, widening economic inequalities.

#### Ecological Impacts:

1. **Disruption of Migratory Patterns**:
    
    - **Effects on Humans**: Changes in migratory patterns of animals can affect ecosystems and biodiversity, impacting ecotourism and local economies that depend on wildlife.
2. **Altered Ecosystem Services**:
    
    - **Effects on Humans**: Loss of ecosystem services such as water purification, flood regulation, and climate regulation can have direct impacts on human health and well-being.
3. **Permafrost Thawing**:
    
    - **Effects on Humans**: Thawing permafrost can release methane, accelerating global warming. It can also damage infrastructure such as roads, buildings, and pipelines, leading to economic costs and potential displacement of communities.

#### Human-Specific Impacts:

1. **Mental Health and Well-being**:
    
    - **Explanation**: The stress and anxiety caused by extreme weather events, displacement, and loss of livelihoods can lead to mental health issues.
    - **Effects**: Increased rates of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and other mental health disorders.
2. **Displacement and Migration**:
    
    - **Explanation**: Sea level rise, extreme weather events, and loss of arable land can force people to migrate.
    - **Effects**: Increased numbers of climate refugees, leading to social, economic, and political challenges in both origin and destination areas.
3. **Heat-Related Illnesses**:
    
    - **Explanation**: Higher temperatures increase the risk of heat-related illnesses such as heatstroke and dehydration.
    - **Effects**: Increased mortality and morbidity, especially among vulnerable populations like the elderly and those with preexisting health conditions.
4. **Infrastructure Damage**:
    
    - **Explanation**: Extreme weather events and rising sea levels can damage infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and buildings.
    - **Effects**: Economic costs of repair and rebuilding, disruption of services, and potential loss of life.
5. **Economic Disruption**:
    
    - **Explanation**: Climate change can disrupt various economic sectors, including agriculture, fisheries, and tourism.
    - **Effects**: Loss of income, increased poverty, and economic instability, particularly in regions heavily dependent on climate-sensitive sectors.
6. **Social Inequality**:
    
    - **Explanation**: Climate change impacts are often more severe for marginalized and vulnerable communities.
    - **Effects**: Widening of social and economic inequalities, as wealthier communities have more resources to adapt and recover.
7. **Impact on Cultural Heritage**:
    
    - **Explanation**: Rising sea levels, extreme weather, and changing landscapes can threaten cultural sites and practices.
    - **Effects**: Loss of cultural heritage and identity, particularly for indigenous communities whose cultures are closely tied to their natural environment.

### Reason for climate change:
The main mechanism behind anthropological climate change is the emission and effect of greenhouse gasses in the earths athmosphere. 
The main reason for this ... is the way thermal radiation is emitted and reflected by all bodies, in particular the plantes in our solar system.
The general mechanism behind 

As the sun has a surface temperature of around 5.500C, it emits most of its energy as shortwave radiation in near-infraread and visable wavelengths as sunlight.
In contrast, earths surface has a much lower temperature, emitting longwave radiation at mid- and far-infraread wavelengths. So if a sunray hits the earths body, the earth absorbs the radiation, and mostly emits 
Greenhouse gasses are gasses that particularly absorb infraread radiation.

Example for these greenhouse gasses include CO2, methane, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and even water vapor in the form of clouds.

### Severn Suzuki Climate Change:
Back then, environmental activism was a very different thing than it is today: not only was the topic orders of magnitude less popular, but the talking points where different as well.
Back then, topics such as 
- The problem of nuclear power
- The destruction of the ozone layer
- The loss of biodiversity
- Water and air pollution
Ozone layer: reflects 

**Biography:**

### Ways to combat climate change:


### Big data collection:
Actually, I have some experience with this, however from the opposite perspective:
Because for some time now I have been very interested in machine learning and data science,
and data collected through online services is often very comfortable to work with:
You could have a very small website with what only appears to be a handful of customers, and they will have a dataset with like 30.000 rows of user data, and you'd look at that and shed some tears of joy.

And thats because many datasets collected in the real world usually involve a lot of missing entries, very unlikely outliers and other issues that require preprocessing of the data,
just due to the fact that people lie about their data, dont answer certain questions etc.
But with datasets collected online, you aren't even asked questions: you click through some dialog to allow the collection of cookies, agree to terms of services that know one besides the laywers writing them will ever read and, without any further action by yourself, you will end up in some column.

And this really is where the issue lies: you become part of a statistic you never conciously agreed to. Data is collected about you without you having a say.

Also, this data is then used to "enhance the user experience" which, realistically, translates to enhanced algorithms designed to make you spend as much time as possible on their websites, with the end goal of you spending more money on products that ads recommend to you

And the only real advantage for you as a user is that you get free content, because the companies can make profit off of you in such an efficient way as to render direct payments unnessisary.

### The green new deal:
The green new deal refers to an idea of public policy that aims to address climate change along with achieving auxilliary goals such as job creation, economic growth and the reduction of inequality at large. There have been significant attempts to get legislation passed in order to introduce these ideas into public policy in a number of contries such as the EU and the US.
The policies mainly focus on creating environmental justice for those disproportionately affected by climate change.

### Greenwashing
Lets begin with a definition: what is green washing?
Green washing refers to the act (of an individual or an organization) of making themselves appear more ecological on the surface than they actually are.
In class, we have identified some greenwashing techniques often observed in even the most ... such as shell: firstly, they often employ language that, while sounding like a promise of significan, isn"t defined in any way that would make claiming it a promise of any kind. Calling yourself "eco-friendly" for example seems like an arguable claim, that however lacks any formal definition to make it such. Additionaly, there is often an emphasis put on small details or products that, while technically being environmentally friendly, dont ecompass a large part of the actual operations of the company: for example, there is often a large emphasis on the footpring and recyclability of the packaging, even if the main product, e.g. a dishwasher, wasn"t produced ecologically at all.
