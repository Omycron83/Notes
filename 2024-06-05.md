- Day after oral exam in english
- Second 3x smolov jr day
- Got up late (around 13:00), went late to bed

- Barely any productivity, looked at some books on focusing more and helped jannis w/ his 5. pk
- Just completing tasks works
- Started to work on daily notes -> this
- Found that video games seem to not make me happy anymore, except w/friends 
-> focus more on fun self improvement stuff
- Figured out that watching youtube videos is probably the single biggest waste of time in my life
	- Start allowing reddit, disallowing youtube as reddit is atleast used reasonably as a second tool of search
- Generally, a day without any goals seemed meaningless -> Need happiness in working

- Good to be nice to people, keep up with them
- Maybe get into habit of going out?
