In datapoint bagging, or bootstrap aggregation, different base estimators in [[Ensemble Learning]] are provided with different subsets of the set of datapoints, such that correlation is reduced and different patterns are learned, similarly to [[Feature Bagging]]. Again, [[Bootstrap Methods|bootstrapping]] is used to sample with replacement from the population sample of datapoints.
