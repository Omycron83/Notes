An event is said to happen **almost surely** if it has probability 1, i.e. when all possible exceptions have probability 0. This highlights that **a probability of 0 doesn't mean impossible**.
When dealing with finite or countable sets as sample spaces, there is no difference between surely and almost surely, as having a probability of one equals the event actually has to entail all possible random variables.
However, with uncountable sets, there a
