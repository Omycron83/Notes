In order to unite the ideas between [[Monte Carlo Methods]] and [[Temporal Difference Methods|Temporal Difference Methods]], one could think of estimating $G_{t:t + n} = R_{t + 1} + \gamma R_{t + 2} + ... + \gamma^{n-1} + \gamma^n \hat{v}(S_{t + n})$ for $0 \leq T \leq T - n$. This is also called the n-step return and may help to remedy inaccuracies induced by bootstrapped estimates while still decreasing suspected correlation between far-away returns effectively. Thus, choosing $n$ carefully is of utmost importance.
