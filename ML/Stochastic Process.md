A stochastic process $\{X_t\}_{t \in T}$ is a set of random variables that is indexed by some other mathematical set, often some point in time $t$. 
The indexing set $T$ is called the **index set**, the set of possible random variables $X_t$ the **state space**.

Often, the change between two index variables is called an **increment** and a single sample from the process a **single outcome** or **realization**.

One usually differentiates between **discrete** and **continuous** stochastic processes, where discrete processes have finite or countable sets while continuous stochastic processes have uncountable sets. 
### Examples:
Brownian motion describes the movement of a submersed in some medium.
