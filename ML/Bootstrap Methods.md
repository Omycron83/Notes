Bootstrap methods are methods that use a population sample to further extract information about the population. 
In statistics, this may be estimating certain population parameters by repeatedly sampling from the population sample with replacement.
In reinforcement learning, this usually refers to methods that use the current estimate of the following states of a transition in tandem with information about the current state in order to update the same estimator itself.
