Early stopping is a machine learning technique used to potentiall reduce overfitting by stopping the training on a training set as soon as validation error starts to increase significantly.
This stems from the theory that, when training a model, the 'obvious', population-specific patterns are discovered first, while 'overfitting', i.e. the discovery of sample-specific patterns happens later in the training process, where a lack of required learning of the affirmentioned patterns leads to the discovery of the latter patterns. 
If that were the case, there would be an optimal point in time where most of the general, but few of the specific patterns are discovered.
