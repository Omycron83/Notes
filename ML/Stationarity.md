### Definition Strict Stationarity:
Let $\{X_t\}$ be a [[Stochastic Process]] and $F_X (x_{t_1+ \tau}, ..., x_{t_n + \tau})$ the [[Univariate Probability Distributions#^e4b749|cdf]] of the unconditional joint distribution of $\{X_t \}$ at times $t_1 + \tau, ..., t_n + \tau$ . $\{X_t \}$ is then called **strictly stationary** if
$F_X (x_{t_1+ \tau}, ..., x_{t_n + \tau}) = F_X (x_{t_1}, ..., x_{t_n}) \forall \tau, t_1, ..., t_n \in R \forall n \in N^*$ 

This means that the distribution of that stochastic process is invariant over time.
