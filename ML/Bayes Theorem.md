Bayes theorem is a theorem in conditional probability theory serving as the basis for [[Bayesian Statistics]]. It is used to form a posterior probability by updating a prior by applying likelihood and normalizing by evidence. 
# Single-variate Bayes:
Given the prior probability $P(A)$ as well as the likelihood $P(B | A)$ and the marginal probability $P(B)$, one can compute the posterior probability $P(A | B)$ by
$P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$

Proof:
	

# Multivariate Bayes:
