Monte carlo methods usually refer to methods in statistics or statistical learning that repeatedly  randomly sample from the population itself to estimate certain population parameters.
In statistics, this may be estimating a certain parameters by sampling a lot from the population (e.g. Estimate $\pi$ by randomly placing points on square with circle inside, making the approximation better with more and more samples)-
In reinforcement learning, this usually refers to methods that use a full trace from the population rather than bootstrapping the following state values.
