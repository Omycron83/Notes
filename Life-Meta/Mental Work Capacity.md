## Working Definition:
_The work-capacity of an individual is the maximum amount of mental fatigue that can be sustained in a given time frame while prevailing adequate performance in relevant mental tasks._

Thus, work capacity is a **non-specific** measure of mental endurance applied to any given tasks at hand, and thus gives information about the mental, systematic stress that can be applied to a mind while retaining performance in the individual tasks they are taxed with. 

An example: one could measure the work-capacity of a person in a given 8-hour work day by the total maximum amount of performance they can deliver
