TLDR: Increased S/B/D/O/Pull Ups from 100kg/90kg/130kg/45kg/10 reps -> 125kg/100kg/145kg/55kg/13 reps in 3 weeks between in august 2024. Felt like a sustainable, fun base program with good gains.
# Introduction:
These are the results of my last 3-week training cycle of the GZCL method applied to an Upper-Lower, UHF, High Volume split.:

GZCL is a popular training methodology you all probably already know. And for a good reason. Thus, when trying to build a new, strength-focused program for me, I wanted to stick to it's given structure of T1, T2 and T3 lifts with different progressions while retaining some of the specific qualities that make me absolutely love all of my workouts. So, a little bit about myself:

This was completed in the last month of my first year of lifting, which you can find an outline of [[My first year of lifting|here]]. Thus, I have a general background in bodybuilding-style work, and experience with high frequency, high volume approaches such as the infamous smolov jr, which I'm planning to run for bench and weighted pull-ups again after this. 

# Program Structure:
![[Pasted image 20240830084903.png]]
The program consisted of 4 different workouts, each structured in a typical GZCL-structure based on one T1 lift. The special twist is the Upper-Lower structure, where the Squat and Deadlift T1/T2 is practiced on lower-days, while on upper days, Push and Pull-Exercises are supersetted. The reason for this is just to allow a higher frequency for both movement patterns, and I dont feel it necessarily discounts my training quality. 

## T1 Selection:
The T1 lifts chosen for Pull are BB Rows and Pullups, with the latter being bodyweight and for reps. 

### T1 Progression:
In the spirit of GZCLLP, I did Dynamic Double Progression between 1 and 3 reps with a total of at least 10 reps for the T1 lifts (besides pull-ups). Each session
