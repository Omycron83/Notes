# Introduction:
These are the results of my last 3-week training cycle of the GZCL method applied to an Upper-Lower, UHF, High Volume split.:

GZCL is a popular training methodology you all probably already know. And for a good reason. Thus, when trying to build a new, strength-focused program for me, I wanted to stick to it's given structure of T1, T2 and T3 lifts with different progressions while retaining some of the specific qualities that make me absolutely love all of my workouts. So, a little bit about myself:

This was completed in the last month of my first year of lifting, which you can find an outline of [[My first year of lifting|here]]. Thus, I have a general background in bodybuilding-style work, and experience with high frequency, high volume approaches such as the infamous smolov jr, which I'm planning to run for bench and weighted pull-ups again after this. 

# Program Structure:

The program consisted of 4 different workouts, each structured in a typical GZCL-structure based on one T1 lift. The special twist is the Upper-Lower structure, where the Squat and Deadlift T1/T2 is practiced on lower-days, while on upper days, Push and Pull-Exercises are supersetted.
