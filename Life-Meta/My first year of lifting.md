So around a year ago (August 2023), I started going to the gym, which was mainly because I a) wanted to get swole and "good at sports" (due to bad experiences with exercising in childhood) and b) because it was so damn fun. I still remember the first time I entered the gym: a more experienced friend of mine had invited me on a whim to try it out, and I still remember the first time getting under a bench. It felt like the coolest thing ever, which will become somewhat of a common theme going forward.

So, due to a lack of knowledge, I started off with a hypertrophy (I wanted to get swole, after all) focused PPL program that an experienced friend of that friend had given to me. It looked roughly like this:

Push:
- BB Bench
- Incline Bench (BB or DB, I did both)
- DB Shoulder Press
- Chest Fly
- Tricep Push down
- Cable Lateral Raises

Pull:
- Assisted Pull Up/Lat Pulldown (I usually did the former, as I desperately wanted to reach a full pull up)
- Cable or Machine Row
- Bicep Curl
- Hammer Curl

Legs:
- Leg Press
- Leg Extensions
- Leg curls 
- Standing calf raises

and this is what I ran with for the first roughly 7-8 months (Also did some quick cardio, which ceased after ca. 4 months or so). There, I saw my first significant giant, which was pretty easy given that I started off very weak:
- Bench: 30kg for reps
- Deadlift: 50kg for reps
- Leg Press (Cable, questionable depth): like 70kg for reps
- Pull Ups: ca. 44kg lifted for reps
- Cable Row: 30kg
- DB Shoulder Press: 10s for reps
- DB Curl: 8kg
- Tricep Push down: 15 for reps
- Lateral Raises: 1.875 cable

and my physique could be described as skinny fat.
During this time, I weighed around 74kg and ate and slept like shit. Pretty low calorie, low protein high carb food in general. Didn't track anything, but I can assure you it wasn't great. Also, at first, the stress really got to my joints. Pull ups in particular made my elbows hurt like hell, and made me dread pull day to the point of only training it around once a week.

During these months though, I made some pretty good gains. 6 months of training this ca. 3-6 times a week (ca. 4 times on average, id assume) got me the following results:
- Bench: 47.5 for reps
- Leg Press: 100kg for reps
- Pull Ups: 60kg total for reps

However, my bodyweight had only risen by about 1kg, though I had undergone some level of body recomposition. Due to a heavy focus on the muscles as well as my love for benching, my chest had gotten somewhat decent, at least for me. 
During this time, I also fine-tuned my program (though no major changes) and started to binge watch science-based lifting channels (I must have watched every RP video in existence) at night. This switched my diet (around 5-6 months in) to something that got me around 120g of protein at maintenance calories.

However, around 5 months ago, I started to focus more on strength, and subsequently altered my program to include deadlifts and squats, while also changing it up to look a lot more like GZCL. I hat gained a couple of kilos (with only a little bit of added bodyfat) and started getting into more of a caloric surplus as well as taking creatine. I did some stupid shit to try to get my bench, squat and pull up numbers up (I yearned for that muscle up), like running smolov Jr for all three lifts combined, 7 days a week. Unfortunately, I got sick the third week, which was a relief since my joints had started to hate me more than the devil. 

However now, one year in, I made some progress:
- Bench: 100kg 1RM
- Squat: 125kg 1RM
- Deadlift: 140kg 1RM
- Pull Ups: 12 @ 81kg
- OHP: 50kg for 3
- BB Row: 60kg for 3
- 1 Muscle Up

and gained weight to ca. 81kg by tracking calories. Currently, I run somewhat of a gzcl program, where I however superset Push and Pull exercises as I feel it doesn't detract in performance while activating my back:
Upper:
- Bench {5x3} SS (Weighted) Pull Ups 
- OHP {4x5} SS BB Row
- Incline Bench {3x5-8} SS Chin UPS
- 4 Sets Chest Fly SS Lateral Raises
- 3 Sets Pushdowns SS Biceps Curls

Lower:
- Squat (5x3)
- Deadlift (3x3)
- Pause Squads (3x5-8)
- RDL/Deficit DL (3x5-8)
- 4 Sets Abs SS Lat Raises 

where I switch Squat and Deadlift and Bench and OHP one day of the week each. When I am in a time crunch or on vacation, I try to get 2-3 full body workouts where I put everything together, omit the T2s that arent T1s and Superset Abs, Tricep, Bicep and Lateral Raises for T3. But in general, I try to go to the gym ca. 4-6 days a week.

Additionally, in the spirit of ..., I decided to train Bench, Squat and DL on sub maximal intensitiy every day in a secondary workout to help with technique work.

My current goals for the rest of the year are then:
- 5 Muscle Ups
- 16 Pull Ups
- 120kg bench
- 60kg OHP
- 80kg BB Row
- 150kg Squat
- 180kg DL

and Id like to reach the 1000 pound club in a year from now.
