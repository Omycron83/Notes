A metric space is an Object $(X, dist)$ containing a set of points $X$ as well as a distance function $dist: X \times X \rightarrow R$ such that:
1. $d(x, y) \ge 0$ (Distances are always positive)
2. $d(x, y) = 0 \implies x = y$ (Points are unique)
3. $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$ (The distance is independent of direction)
4. $d(x, z) \le d(x, y) + d(y, z)$ (The triangle-inequality holds)
