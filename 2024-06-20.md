- Got up at 9am (6hr sleep)
	- After delayed alarm, fix that already!!
- Went to party late at night day before, was ok
	- Some others had a great time, I tried to pretend and it only semi worked
		- Sleep deprivation didnt hit that hard
- Did homework day earlier, good idea
- Did workout, I suck at proper push ups
- Wanted to play volleyball, fell into the water
	- Dont try to hang around people you dont genuinly enjoy spending time with
- Everything else sucked, wasnt even that productive
	- Dont think about your life, youll regret it
	- Just do, and stop caring about anything working out
	- You might never have what others have, just due to your character
	- You know when something is gonna work out, and thus should know when it doesn't
		- Abandon all hope, its not conducive to a healthy life
		- Some things arent meant to be, fuck you
	- If you feel bad, work more
- I dont know if doing this helps or demotivates me
