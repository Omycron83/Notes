So around a year ago (August 2023), I started going to the gym, which was mainly because I a) wanted to get swole and "good at sports" (due to bad experiences with exercising in childhood) and b) because it was so damn fun. I still remember the first time I entered the gym: a more experienced friend of mine had invited me on a whim to try it out, and I still remember the first time getting under a bench. It felt like the coolest thing ever, which will become somewhat of a common theme going forward.

So, due to a lack of knowledge, I started off with a hypertrophy (I wanted to get swole, after all) focused PPL program that an experienced friend of that friend had given to me. It looked roughly like this:

Push:
- BB Bench
- Incline Bench (BB or DB, I did both)
- DB Shoulder Press
- Chest Fly
- Tricep Push down
- Cable Lateral Raises

Pull:
- Assisted Pull Up/Lat Pulldown (I usually did the former, as I desperately wanted to reach a full pull up)
- Cable or Machine Row
- Bicep Curl
- Hammer Curl

Legs:
- Leg Press
- Leg Extensions
- Leg curls 
- Standing calf raises

and this is what I ran with for the first roughly 7-8 months (Also did some quick cardio, which ceased after ca. 4 months or so). There, I saw my first significant giant, which was pretty easy given that I started off very weak:
- Bench: 30kg for reps
- Deadlift: 50kg for reps
- Leg Press (Cable, questionable depth): like 70kg for reps
- Pull Ups: ca. 44kg lifted for reps
- Cable Row: 30kg
- DB Shoulder Press: 10s for reps
- DB Curl: 8kg
- Tricep Push down: 15 for reps
- Lateral Raises: 1.875 cable

During this time, I weighed
