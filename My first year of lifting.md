So around a year ago (August 2023), I started going to the gym, which was mainly because I a) wanted to get swole and "good at sports" (due to bad experiences with exercising in childhood) and b) because it was so damn fun.

It felt like the coolest thing ever, which will become somewhat of a common theme going forward.

So, due to a lack of knowledge, I started off with a hypertrophy (I wanted to get swole, after all) focused PPL program
