- Got up at 6am, 6hrs of sleep
- Went running for 30mins (ca. 4km)
- Did morning Routine
- Always try to finish sleep cycles!!
- -> Woke up 3, mins 

=> Felt awesome, really more motivated
-> I need this, really! 

- Decision if I get bike
- Decided for TU, against ETH
- Money would be VERY tight
- Couldn't concentrate well on studies at first
- Lose entire livelyhood without wanting that
- **Can't dual major math and cs**
- However, need to do master at ETH afterwards

Plan for today:
- Drive back home, get more comfy w/ command line Linux during that
- Read a bit of some classic literature (Smith?)
- Work through 15 pages of uni
- Upper Workout
- Write email uni
- Send application math, cs
- Figure out phone addiction
